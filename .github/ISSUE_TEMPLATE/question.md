not as GitHub issues. You'll get faster responses and can engage with other users.

GitHub issues are for:
✅ Bug reports (technical problems)
✅ Feature requests (new functionality)
✅ Documentation issues

Discord is for:
💬 Setup help and troubleshooting
💬 Usage questions  
💬 General discussions
💬 Community support
